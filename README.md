# Conteneur
The problem is to define a generic ADT for a particular data container, the basic type of the values contained being parametric. This container contains its own values, therefore not a reference or pointer to external data. The maximum capacity of the container is a parameter fixed at its construction, which can be modified exclusively by copying or transferring a container of the same type. We will assume that the type of the master data allows at least the comparisons of equality (==) and strict inequality (<); the data thus belong to a total order. This container accepts two types of accesses: a "random" read access according to an index provided and "associative" access on a value basis, in reading and writing. Both accesses can be unsuccessful if there is no element in the container corresponding to the specified criterion. These two accesses must be efficient: random access is in constant time, independent of capacity and occupancy rate, while associative access is, on average, of logarithmic temporal complexity. depending on the number of elements contained. Inserting and deleting elements has this same logarithmic mean complexity.
